# Temporary branch with my tools

-   aws-script.py - use to work with AWS easily. Install `boto3` for Python 3 and enter credentials into ~/.aws/credentials
    - You MUST edit `create` and `ssh` functions to use your own values (key and security group) and commands (ssh), I have it set up for my machine.

- aws-skripty.sh - bash version of some basic AWS commands. Do not use.
